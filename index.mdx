### About Phinite

Phinite is an AI-first orchestration platform that empowers businesses to build, deploy, and manage multi-agent conversational experiences — without writing a single line of code. Whether it’s automating sales calls, handling customer support, or managing backend workflows through voice or chat, Phinite enables teams to create agents that act, talk, and think like trained representatives.

Built with enterprise-grade scalability and speed in mind, Phinite removes the complexity of deploying AI agents across telephony, web, messaging, and internal systems. It allows you to design conversational logic using prompts, orchestrate multiple agents together, and tightly integrate with your existing stack (CRM, ticketing, databases, etc.).
