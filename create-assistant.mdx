# Create an Assistant

An **Assistant** in Phinite is a multi-skilled AI agent that can communicate, take actions, and orchestrate workflows through flows and nodes.\
Each Assistant is scoped to a specific **workspace** and **environment**, and can be customized with prompts, tools, and knowledge sources.

---

## Prerequisites

Before creating an Assistant:

- You must have access to a **workspace** 
- You need the role of **Admin**, **Architect**, or **Developer**.
- Decide type of assistant 
  - Conversational
  - Email assistant
  - Automonous

---

## Create Your First Assistant

### 1. Navigate to the Assistants Dashboard

- From the left navigation menu, click **Assistants**.
- You’ll see a list of existing assistants in your current workspace and environment.

### 2. Click **“Create Assistant”**

- A modal or creation form will appear.

### 3. Fill Out Basic Details

| Field              | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assistant Name** | A unique, descriptive name for your assistant (e.g., “Dental Appointment Bot”). |
| **Description**    | Short explanation of what the assistant does.                                   |
| **Type**           | Selected assistant type  `conversatinal`, `Email`, `Autonomous`.                |

- Define default settings like:
  - Temperature
  - Max tokens
  - Response mode (text, voice)
- Optional: Attach a default **Knowledge Base**.

### 6. Save & Launch Builder

- Click **Create Assistant**.
- You’ll be redirected to the **Flow Builder**, where you can design your agent’s logic visually.
